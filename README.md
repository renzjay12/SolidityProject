# My Token (Solidity)

Create and manage your own token with the MyToken contract. Itâ€™s designed to be flexible and adaptable, making it suitable for various use cases. MyToken empowers you to create your own digital assets.

# Getting Started

Installing/ Using Online Compiler

* Solidity compiler (version >= 0.8.0 recommended) - You can install this or use an online compiler like Remix.

### Executing Program

1. **Access Remix**: Open your web browser and visit Remix.

2. **Create a New File**:
   - If you haven't already, create a new file named `MyToken.sol`.
   - Paste your `MyToken` contract code into this file.

3. **Compile the Contract**:
   - Click the "Compile" button in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Ensure there are no compilation errors displayed in the bottom panel.

4. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" button in the left-hand sidebar.
   - In the "Deploy" section, select the contract named "MyToken."
   - Click the "Deploy" button.
   - If you've connected a wallet, approve the transaction to deploy the contract.
   - Remix will display the transaction details and the deployed contract address upon successful deployment.

5. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, use the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel to interact with the contract's functions (e.g., minting and burning tokens).
